# One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on string: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or 0 edits) away.

# if a string is 0 edits away then this means that one string is a permutation of the other
# if a string is 1 edit away this means one character can either be added, removed or replaced
